- `animation/tweening/` - Easing functions
- `input/mouse_input/` - Mouse tracking
- `input/keyboard_input/` - Key handling
- `input/gamepad_input/` - Controller support

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented

- `physics/*` - Files exist but need verification

### ❌ Missing Implementations

- `audio/basic_audio/` - Basic player exists but needs enhancement
- `audio/ogg_playback/` - File exists but quality unclear
- `audio/audio_mixing/` - File exists but quality unclear

## Recommended Actions

1. **Complete missing demos**: Focus on physics and advanced features
2. **Enhance visual appeal**: Replace basic shapes with engaging graphics
3. **Add progressive difficulty**: Create learning paths within categories
4. **Implement achievement system**: Track user progress
5. **Add guided tutorials**: Step-by-step learning experiences
